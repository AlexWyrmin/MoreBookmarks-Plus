#Folder contains a modified landed_titles where I am slowly adding in MCN names

#NB_newtitles_l_english needs referenced for ensuring I didn't re-localize a title and didn't note that in the landed_titles. I marked new and changed titles this way


#Provinces that are new or changed are marked with #Changed. In most cases these provinces have names in CK2 that can be ported over
#Cultural naming probably won't be changed by the upcoming DLC as melting pots will likely just have a tag like 'parent = x' to just take localization and other features from the parent culture
#Porting only includes vanilla cultures and not new ones. When adding those I will only worry about areas where that culture normally would be IE I won't worry about there being a Carantanian name for Constantinople.
