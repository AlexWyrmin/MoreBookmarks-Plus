Bookmarks:

#When adding new bookmarks look at the error log for duplicate characters from vanilla files or other character errors like fathers being set as woman or people set as their own father. A bookmark WILL NOT LOAD if it has any assertion errors in the error log.
#The background for each date is a .dds file in \gfx\interface\bookmarks 
#Icons are set in \gfx\interface\icons\bookmark_big and \gfx\interface\icons\bookmark_buttons 
#Character portraits are set with the command dump_bookmark_portraits once you load a bookmark. Those go in bookmark_portraits and when generated go to \Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\common\bookmark_portraits in your documents directory
#Positions are updated in real time and aren't too hard to setup

#History data is mostly fixed up to 1310. No to little data for dates before 867.

- New Cultures -

I generally used M&T in EU4 for a broad idea of language spread though that is a culture map of 1356 which is the end of CK's timeframe. Main focus was to break up some of the larger cultures such as Occitan and French but there are exceptions to this. Rus' for example is fully correct for this time period as the cultural subdivisions of east slavic cultures did not truly start to form till EU4's time period.

I generally made families that controlled a region for a long period of time whichever culture the area they own is. House Savoy, for example, was marked French in CK3 and HIP but likely originated from Magdeburg all the way in Saxony but my guess is they were marked French since they maybe spoke French (though in that case most of western Europe would be 'French') or maybe it was based on the House Savoy of EU4's time period. It made more sense to make the family Arpitan than French.


Cultures marked with whether they are from HIP or what parent culture I used as a basis. Names are exactly as they are in the culture file. Localization is based on cultural names to match community title project.

My edits are generally at the top of a file.

Titles:

Capital holding is whatever barony is first under a county in landed_titles. Duchy capital is whatever county is first regardless of what county is set with 'capital' which is stupid.

Used SWMH naming for added titles for easy copy pasting

Re-localized counties/duchies marked 

This in a history file sets capital
		effect = {
			set_capital_county = title:c_raniriki
		}
		
		
Detailing:

Eventually will further detail the map but will not go overboard as while you can add 100 new provinces to France it will greatly imbalance the map and make traveling across northern France take as long as traveling across all of Tibet and also ruins a lot of the strategic movement as gameplay should always come first. All counties should have at least 2 baronies unless they are a tiny island such as Malta. Some islands will not be broken up into separate counties (such as the Adriatic Isles) until CK3 actually implements Republics. 

Most counties should have 3 baronies so they can have 1 of each holding type. Duchy capitals at 4 baronies unless it's a tiny duchy and Kingdom capitals should have 5 with very rare cases of 6. 


First parenthesis is the amount of baronies. Some areas like Iberia are heavily impacted by de_jure changes as Andalusia shrinks. I base the initial number on the 1166 bookmark as that's the one I mainly play and it's a nice middle point
