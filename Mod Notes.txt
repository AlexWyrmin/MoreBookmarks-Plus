####Bookmarks####


#When adding new bookmarks look at the error log for duplicate characters from vanilla files or other character errors like fathers being set as woman or people set as their own father. A bookmark WILL NOT LOAD if it has any assertion errors in the error log.
#The background for each date is a .dds file in \gfx\interface\bookmarks 
#Icons are set in \gfx\interface\icons\bookmark_big and \gfx\interface\icons\bookmark_buttons 
#Character portraits are set with the command dump_bookmark_portraits once you load a bookmark. Those go in bookmark_portraits and when generated go to \Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\common\bookmark_portraits in your documents directory
#Positions are updated in real time and aren't too hard to setup

#History data is mostly fixed up to 1310. No to little data for dates before 867.

- New Cultures -

I generally used M&T in EU4 for a broad idea of language spread though that is a culture map of 1356 which is the end of CK's timeframe. Main focus was to break up some of the larger cultures such as Occitan and French but there are exceptions to this. Rus' for example is fully correct for this time period as the cultural subdivisions of east slavic cultures did not truly start to form till EU4's time period.

I generally made families that controlled a region for a long period of time whichever culture the area they own is. House Savoy, for example, was marked French in CK3 and HIP but likely originated from Magdeburg all the way in Saxony but my guess is they were marked French since they maybe spoke French (though in that case most of western Europe would be 'French') or maybe it was based on the House Savoy of EU4's time period. It made more sense to make the family Arpitan than French.


Cultures marked with whether they are from HIP or what parent culture I used as a basis. Names are exactly as they are in the culture file.

My edits are generally at the top of a file.



Culture group change:

Occitan and all its dialects are now in the Iberian group instead of Frankish
Assyrian in own cultural group

To do:


Mostly avoiding cultural groups at the moment since CK3 handles most events/decisions either by region or cultural group plus it causes massive compatbility issues with other mods like Community Flavor Pack and Community Title Project. New cultural groups also just make more negative opinion malus' more rampant for little else being gained unlike cultures which are used to define dynasties, names, and character appearances.


	
####Map and Titles####

Eventually will further detail the map but will not go overboard as while you can add 100 new provinces to France it will greatly imbalance the map and make traveling across northern France take as long as traveling across all of Tibet. It also ruins a lot of the strategic movement as gameplay should always come first which is also why a bunch of tiny baronies should be avoided. All counties should have at least 3 baronies unless they are a tiny island such as Malta or a tiny county. Not making new counties except in rare cases as the current county count is acceptable. Some islands can still be broken up into separate counties (such as the Adriatic Isles) but won't worry about that until CK3 actually implements Republics. Since the DLC is so far away this probably won't be done till the Summer.


Most counties should have 3 baronies so they can have 1 of each holding type. Duchy capitals at 4 baronies unless it's a tiny duchy and Kingdom capitals should have 5 with very rare cases of 6.

Red - Baronies that need replaced or altered.

First parenthesis is the amount of baronies. Some areas like Iberia are heavily impacted by de_jure changes as Andalusia shrinks. These counts are after the 300 baronies I've already added.
