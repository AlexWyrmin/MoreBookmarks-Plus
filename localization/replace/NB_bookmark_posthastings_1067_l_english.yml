 bm_867:0 "The Viking Age"
 bm_867_desc:1 "By the middle of the 9th century, the Norse raiders and adventurers known as the Vikings had already begun to set their indelible mark on the map of Europe, establishing realms in Russia and the British Isles and travelling and raiding as far as the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Karling rulers, descendants of Charlemagne, ruled mighty realms in France, Germany and Italy, while the Muslim religion was now firmly established in Spain under the Umayyads. The Byzantine emperor held on, though suffering under increasing pressure from the Caliphate and the Bulgarians. West of the fractured Steppes, The Magyars were poised to make their claim on the Carpathian basin. Islam was spreading rapidly in Persia under rulers such as the Saffarids, and had penetrated into the Indus valley. Further East, the Hindu Pratihara dynasty was expanding."

His later accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of England and Denmark together. Cnut sought to keep this power-base by uniting Danes and English under cultural bonds of wealth and custom, as well as through sheer brutality. After a decade of conflict with opponents in Scandinavia, Cnut claimed the crown of Norway in Trondheim in 1028.

Despite near-constant warfare, Basil distinguished himself as an administrator, reducing the power of the great land-owning families who dominated the Empire's administration and military, filling its treasury, and leaving it with its greatest expanse in four centuries. Although his successors were largely incapable rulers, the Empire flourished for decades after Basil's death.

The marchlands of the region, which had long resisted Buyid authority, were finally subjugated. The Turkish mercenaries, however, became discontented over the presence Sultan al-Dawla's Daylamite troops. They therefore raised a brother of the amir, Musharrif al-Dawla, as their ruler in 1021.

On the other hand, Hakim's Syrian policy was successful as he managed to extend Fatimid hegemony to the emirate of Aleppo. Above all, the persistent rivalries between the various factions of the Fatimid armies, especially the Berbers and the Turks, overshadowed the other problems of Hakim's caliphate. Al-Ḥākim upheld diplomatic relations between the Fatimid Empire and many different countries. Skillful diplomacy was needed in establishing a friendly if not neutral basis of relations with the Byzantine Empire, which had expansionary goals in the early 11th century. Perhaps the farthest reaching diplomatic mission of his was to the Song Dynasty."

He initiated his arduous campaign to crush his rivals and reconquer the lost territory in Italy to reform the Holy Roman Empire. The Magyars settled down in the Carpathian Basin and began to make their mark on the world as they conquered and pillaged their neighbors, becoming feared across Europe. In the north the Christians were trying to push into the Scandinavian Peninsula to start converting the pagan kings, but the Germanic faith still stood strong among the vikings. In Baghdad far to the south-east, the ancient Abbasid Caliphate that once ruled an empire stretching from Persia to Hispania finally fell to infighting, left only with the heartland of their former empire. And on the shores of Africa a new rival rose up in the form of the Fatimid Caliphate, ready to fill the vacant regions left behind by their adversary. \n\n#bold Who will stand victorious after this tumultuous time in history?#!"

In his later years, after his coronation as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, he had to continue his struggles in Italy to keep his newfound empire under control.

Modern historians regard him as the first King of England and one of the greatest Anglo-Saxon kings. Æthelstan centralised government; he increased control over the production of charters and summoned leading figures from distant areas to his councils. These meetings were also attended by rulers from outside his territory, especially Welsh kings, who thus acknowledged his overlordship. More legal texts survive from his reign than from any other 10th-century English king. They show his concern about widespread robberies, and the threat they posed to social order. His legal reforms built on those of his grandfather, Alfred the Great. Æthelstan was one of the most pious West Saxon kings, and was known for collecting relics and founding churches. His household was the centre of English learning during his reign, and it laid the foundation for the Benedictine monastic reform later in the century."

Ever the opportunist, Manuel had long ago concluded a pact with the King of Hungary, István III, whereby István’s brother Belá would be educated at the Imperial court in Constantinople. Manuel had as-of-yet been without legitimate male issue, and intended Belá to be married to his daughter Maria, to eventually rule alongside her as Emperor. Sensing opportunity, however, Manuel decided to move against István and press his son-in-law’s claims on the duchies of Dalmatia and Croatia. With those titles secured, Belá is now a landed vassal of Manuel, and the heir to the Kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary.

When Henry became King of England in 1154, as Henry II, he ruled as king, duke or count over a large empire of kingdoms, duchies and counties that spanned from Scotland to the Pyrenees.

Not long after Nur ad-Din's death in 1174, Saladin launched his conquest of Syria, peacefully entering Damascus at the request of its governor. Under Saladin's command, the Ayyubid army defeated the Crusaders at the decisive Battle of Hattin in 1187, and thereafter wrested control of Palestine—including the city of Jerusalem—from the Crusaders, who had conquered the area 88 years earlier. Although the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem continued to exist until the late 13th century, its defeat at Hattin marked a turning point in its conflict with the Muslim powers of the region."

 bm_prelude_desc:1 "The Komnenoi have fallen from the imperial throne, and Byzantium is falling with them. The newly-formed Kingdoms of Serbia and Bulgaria have declared their independence from the Byzantine crown, the Seljuk Sultans of Rum press against the Empire’s restored borders in Anatolia, and an independent Béla III rules in Hungary and Croatia. All of Manuel Komnenos’s dreams have come to naught, but this is a time of opportunity, for those wise enough to see it. Alexios Komnenos, an infant member of the royal Komnenos dynasty, rules in Trebizond. If he can gather support enough to press his claim on Byzantium, the young Komnenos can work to restore the golden age his family’s untimely fall from grace brought to a close. Meanwhile Jerusalem stands poised to fall to Saladin while King Henry II of England, King Philip II of France, and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick 'Barbarossa' continue to fight amongst themselves."

The result was the tragic sack of Constantinople and the subsequent establishment of the so called Latin Empire. Almost none of the Crusaders even reached the Holy Land.

Andronikos Doukas Angelos was the son of Constantine Angelos and Theodora Komnene, the youngest daughter of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and Irene Doukaina. Thus Isaac was a member of the extended imperial clan of the Komnenoi. On 11 September 1185, while Andronikos was absent from the capital, his lieutenant Stephen Hagiochristophorites moved to arrest Isaac. Isaac killed Hagiochristophorites and took refuge in the church of Hagia Sophia. Andronikos was a capable ruler in some ways but was hated for his cruelty and his efforts to keep the aristocracy obedient. Isaac appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose that spread rapidly over the whole city. When Andronikos returned he found that he had lost popular support, and that Isaac had been proclaimed emperor."

Then in 1182, he succeeded in capturing the city of Cotyaeum from the Byzantines. In 1185, he made peace with Emperor Isaac II Angelus, but the next year he transferred power to his eleven sons, who immediately fought each other for control.

The prevalence of the Italian nickname, even in later German usage, reflects the centrality of the Italian campaigns to his career.  Historians consider him among the Holy Roman Empire's greatest medieval emperors. He combined qualities that made him appear almost superhuman to his contemporaries: his longevity, his ambition, his extraordinary skills at organization, his battlefield acumen and his political perspicacity.

As the Crusades progressed, he acquired control of Jerusalem and styled himself its king. At the age of three, he was crowned King of Sicily as a co-ruler with his mother, Constance of Hauteville, the daughter of Roger II of Sicily. Frequently at war with the papacy, which was hemmed in between Frederick's lands in northern Italy and his Kingdom of Sicily (the Regno) to the south, he was excommunicated three times and often vilified in pro-papal chronicles of the time and after. Pope Gregory IX went so far as to call him an Antichrist."

Vaisvilkas has expanded Lithuania to the east, and in so doing has inadvertently made Lithuania one of the de facto gateguards of Europe alongside the Kingdoms of Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria, and the Grand Duchy of Novgorod. Although Vaisvilkas’s realm is still relatively small, his pious Christianity buys him time and potential support from other Christian rulers. If he can gain that support and use it to hold off the Mongol horde, the ambitious young King of Lithuania might well be able to recover some of his ancestral lands lost to the Teuton knights… \n\n Meanwhile in Europe the House of Hohenstaufen is no more with the death of Manfred with Charles I of Anjou now ruling Sicily. Meanwhile in the Holy Roman Empire Richard Plantagenet, through bribes to the German electorate, has been elected as King of the Germans. His election is not a simple one, however. It raises serious questions about the future of the Holy Roman Empire. The powerful Plantagenet England is a strong ally of the Emperor—one that he may need, for the Holy Roman Empire is dangerously imbalanced. If danger from outside Kings is not enough, Ottokar II of Bohemia has expanded toward the Adriatic sea, massing power and support for his own potential election. Can the House of Plantagenet maintain control through another election?"

He put a final end to the Almohads, unified Morocco, established their new grandiose capital at Fez el-Jedid and gave the Marinids their foothold in Spain"

A weal ruler a papal legate, Philip, bishop of Fermo, came to Hungary to help Ladislaus consolidate his authority, but the prelate was shocked at the presence of thousands of pagan Cumans in Hungary. Ladislaus promised that he would force them to adopt a Christian lifestyle, but they refused to obey the legate's demands. Ladislaus decided to support the Cumans, for which Philip of Fermo excommunicated him. The Cumans imprisoned the legate, and the legate's partisans captured Ladislaus. In early 1280, Ladislaus agreed to persuade the Cumans to submit to the legate, but many Cumans preferred to leave Hungary. Ladislaus vanquished a Cuman army that invaded Hungary in 1282. Hungary also survived a Mongol invasion in 1285. Ladislaus had, by that time, become so unpopular that many of his subjects accused him of inciting the Mongols to invade Hungary."

 bm_1307_desc:1 "With the breakup of the Sultanate of the Rum and the decline of the Byzantine Empire, several warlords in Anatolia seek fame and glory in the ensuing power vacuum. Foremost among them is Osman, a pious and brave man. According to a dream he had many, many years ago, great things are in store for Osman and his dynasty. They might even conquer great Constantinople one day. But the journey to Constantinople won’t be easy, and the Byzantine Empire, which has resisted attack after attack for almost a thousand years, will not go down without a fight. \n\n Over in Europe due to the untimely death of the Polish monarch without a favorable heir, Vaclav II Premyslid of Bohemia has been crowned king in place of another Piast. This gives Vaclav—heir to Ottokar, and all the desire for revenge against the Hohenstaufens that comes with being his son—a great deal of power in Europe. If Vaclav is given time to consolidate and expand it is unlikely the Holy Roman Empire will ever be able to reassert its authority over Bohemia, with its control of the Italian peninsula already crumbling. The time to move is now!"

He undertook measures to impoverish them and felt it was justified because he knew the Hindu chiefs and muqaddams led a luxurious life but didn't pay a jital in taxes.

At first, many Mongol nobles were against him and organized a plot to kill the new khan. Öz Beg discovered the plot and crushed the rebels. His adoption of Islam as a state religion led to a conspiracy of Shamanist and Buddhist princes, whom he subdued severely. Khan Öz Beg urged the Mongol elite to convert to Islam, but at the same time, he preserved the lives of Christians and pagans such as Russians, Circassians, Alans, Finno-Ugric people, and Crimean Greeks as long as they continued to pay the jizyah in subjection to Islamic rule.

He outlived his eldest son, Edward the Black Prince, and the throne passed to his grandson, Richard II. After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337. This started what became known as the Hundred Years' War. Following some initial setbacks, this first phase of the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at Crécy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Brétigny, in which England made territorial gains, and Edward renounced his claim to the French throne.

At first, Edward seemed to accept Philip's succession, but he pressed his claim to the throne of France after a series of disagreements with Philip. The result was the beginning of the Hundred Years' War in 1337. After initial successes at sea, Philip's navy was annihilated at the Battle of Sluys in 1340, ensuring that the war would occur on the continent.
