culture\culture_names. This is used to turn the name Adam, for example, into the different versions of Adam such as if a Greek turned himself into a Levantine.

- New Cultures -


When adding new cultures I'll only add cultures that have a non mutually intelligible language and/or a culture that varied enough from the parent culture I'm splitting up. So no insignificant dialects or things that didn't exist in this time period (Austrian German). I generally used M&T in EU4 for a broad idea of language spread though that is a culture map of 1356 which is the end of CK's timeframe. Main focus was to break up some of the larger cultures such as Occitan and French but there are exceptions to this. Rus' for example is fully correct for this time period as the cultural subdivisions of east slavic cultures did not truly start to form till EU4's time period.

I generally made families that controlled a region for a long period of time whichever culture the area they own is. House Savoy, for example, was marked French in CK3 and HIP but likely originated from Magdeburg all the way in Saxony but my guess is they were marked French since they maybe spoke French (though in that case most of western Europe would be 'French') or maybe it was based on the House Savoy of EU4's time period. It made more sense to make the family Arpitan than French.


-All of these will need gone over for Community Title Project. Most can just be copied from the parent culture IE French can cover all the French dialects. HIP cultures can have most aspects copied over from HIP-


Cultures marked with whether they are from HIP or what parent culture I used as a basis. Names are exactly as they are in the culture file. Localization is based on cultural names to match community title project.

My edits are generally at the top of a file.

To do:

Guanche for Canary Isles. 

Tamazight
Tarafit
No breakup of Maghrebi as even today the dialects are very mutually intelligable
Add Taureg 

Malayalam. Western coastal dialect that formed in CK's timeframe
Munda. Actual culture/language and not a dialect. Has a county and landed character already.


Avoiding cultural groups at the moment since CK3 handles most events/decisions either by region or cultural group plus it causes massive compatbility issues with other mods like Community Flavor Pack and Community Title Project. New cultural groups also just make more negative opinion malus' more rampant for little else being gained unlike cultures which are used to define dynasties, names, and character appearances.
