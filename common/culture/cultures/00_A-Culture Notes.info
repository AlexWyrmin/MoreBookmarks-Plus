- New Cultures -


When adding new cultures I'll only add cultures that have a non mutually intelligible language and/or a culture that varied enough from the parent culture I'm splitting up. So no insignificant dialects or things that didn't exist in this time period (Austrian German). I generally used M&T in EU4 for a broad idea of language spread though that is a culture map of 1356 which is the end of CK's timeframe. Main focus was to break up some of the larger cultures such as Occitan and French but there are exceptions to this. Rus' for example is fully correct for this time period as the cultural subdivisions did not start to form till EU4's time period. No interest in adding small minorities that will have no on map characters that also would only hold 1 county (which will be quickly converted) such as the various Middle East Christians who can just be covered with Assyrian.

I generally made families that controlled a region for a long period of time whichever culture the area they own is. House Savoy, for example, was marked French in CK3 and HIP but likely originated from Magdeburg all the way in Saxony but my guess is they were marked French since they maybe spoke French (though in that case most of western Europe would be 'French') or maybe it was based on the House Savoy of EU4's time period. It made more sense to make the family Arpitan than French.

-All of these will need gone over for Community Title Project. Most can just be copied from the parent culture IE French can cover all the French dialects. HIP cultures can have most aspects copied over from HIP-

Cultures marked with whether they are from HIP or what parent culture I used as a basis. Names are exactly as they are in the culture file.

My edits are generally at the top of a file.

Occitan and all its dialects are now in the Iberian group instead of Frankish
Assyrian in own cultural group

To do:

Friulian. Actual culture/language and not a dialect
Romansh. Actual culture/language and not a dialect
Piedmontese. Was more of a Occitan/Italian mix in CK's timeframe
Re-name Cisalpine to Lombard. Cisalpine is the name of the entire language family that I already partially broke up 
Tuscan. Mostly to go with the below Central Italian change
Re-name Central Italian to Umbrian. Mostly since it's a better name. Won't add the 'Laziale' that HIP had as I can't find anything on it and M&T just has Umbrian cover it. I think 'Laziale' is supposed to be 'Latin' due to the Papal States but no need for that 
Neapolitan for Sicily
CK3 has a 'Lombard' in the south. Re-name it to Langobard
Maltese

Guanche for Canary Isles. 

Bedouin for north African regions they inhabited such as parts of Libya and Siwa. CK3 mostly uses Maghrebi to cover them
Tamazight
Tarafit
No breakup of Maghrebi as even today the dialects are very mutually intelligable
Double check Coptic religion/culture matchups

Possibly break up Levantine into Iraqi and Syrian then re-name Levantine into one of those (probably Syrian since it covers a larger area). Even HIP considered this but didn't due to uncertainty about character cultures but for most the start dates the rulers are turkish instead of arab anyway
Add Outremer culture in Crusader areas for later start dates. Culture already in the files.

Omani. CK is before Oman really became more important but it still was culturally and relgiously different from other Arabs in CK's timeframe
Bahraini. An Arabic that is not fully mutually intelligable and more influenced by Persian

Malayalam. Western coastal dialect that formed in CK's timeframe
Munda. Actual culture/language and not a dialect



Avoiding cultural groups at the moment since CK3 handles most events/decisions either by region or cultural group plus it causes massive compatbility issues with other mods like Community Flavor Pack and Community Title Project. New cultural groups also just make more negative opinion malus' more rampant for little else being gained unlike cultures which are used to define dynasties, names, and character appearances.
