- New Cultures -

I generally made families that controlled a region for a long period of time whichever culture the area they own is. House Savoy, for example, was marked French in CK3 and HIP but likely originated from Magdeburg all the way in Saxony but my guess is they were marked French since they maybe spoke French (though in that case most of western Europe would be 'French') or maybe it was based on the House Savoy of EU4's time period. It made more sense to make the family Arpitan than French for CK3. Another reason for this is for gameplay purposes to avoid opinion malus'.


Many of these cultures are divergent or hybrids and only exist in later bookmarks roughly around when they were first attested. A culture was generally added if it did exist in a wider area and would actually have rulers.
