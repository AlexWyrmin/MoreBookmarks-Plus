#There's an unknown issue causing a crash with my mod when it's used by itself. This issue does not occur when the mods used with CE and my compatches and I have been unable to figure out the issue so far. 
#
#My CE compatch itself is basic and only compatches CCU and scripted effects (to remove most of CE's map changes) with me instead compatching CE cultures inside the EPE compatch. My CE cultures as far as I can tell do not have anything in them that should cause an issue but my best guess is that it is a CE culture that's then compatched by my EPE compatch that's causing the issue though whether it's a culture file, a decision, or a trigger scope I have no idea. The error log gives zero errors that'd help find this problem outside this as the last part of the error log when a crash occurs:
#
#[02:54:59][jomini_script_system.cpp:262]: Script system error!
#  Error: Left side and right side during comparison were of different types (left was 'religion', right was 'faith')
#  Script location: file: common/script_values/01_starting_values.txt line: 220
#  
#Which as far as I can tell deals with cultural acceptance changes. I don't believe it has anything to do with a faith/religion since then it'd make no sense why using CE would make the crash not occur.
