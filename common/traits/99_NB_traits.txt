#CK3 has no 'one handed' trait but maimed removes a hand from a character but it comes with the health reduction and a ton of other negatives. There's already 3 other variations of wounded so turning this into CK2's one-handed trait. Easier to modify this one trait than modify the many vanilla files that handle these traits to add a new one for one handed
