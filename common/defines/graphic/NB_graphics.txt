NMapModes = {
	LARGE_IMPASSABLE_PROVINCE_PIXELS = 80000 # How many pixels qualify the impassible province as too big to be included in map colors and names #Lowered from 100000. Personally I don't like wasteland coloring and always disabled it in EU4 and CK2 as it gives the impression of a nation controlling a larger area than they really do as no that medieval Turkish Empire isn't collecting taxes from the middle of the Sahara. At this setting places like most of the Sahara, Arabian Desert, and Siberia will stay not colored in no matter what.
