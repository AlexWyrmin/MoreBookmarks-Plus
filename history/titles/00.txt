#Put the many k_ level titles into overall larger files for better organization and easier editing. The game only reads these files when making a new game so there's no need for, for example, over 8 different history files for every Kingdom in Iberia when they can all be put into 1 Iberia file which prevents things like having to juggle 3 different files to modify the territory of Castille. The new files are organized and setup for easy searching between the different Kingdom titles

#Order in title history matters. A duchy below the counties it has a de_jure_liege effect on will not be controlled by that duchy if they are above the duchy in the history file
